# Turning gross teacher shortage areas list into data

The federal government keeps a list of instruction categories where there
are teacher shortages in each state, Puerto Rico, and at some other places
that I don't need to know about for the project I'm doing right now.

Unfortunately the data is in a list, in a word doc. I couldn't find a
spreadsheet version of it anywhere, so this is a quick-and-dirty
translation to CSV.
